1) Cursor is wrong sometimes
2) Grab top most split and drag down (and it nukes a bunch of splits)
3) Component requires focus before ctrl works.  So rather than pressing ctrl to put it into copy mode, one has to hit ctrl and move the mouse a little.
4) dragging sliders causes browser to try to grab text.  Would like for all mouse events to be suppressed within children during drag.
